# Sim.js
This is the initial implementation of the sim1.

I switched to JS when I realized I had not yet understood the shape the code would eventually take. JavaScripts flexibility enabled me to prototype fast and figure some things out before going back to a typed language.

## Obsolete
The code here should be considered obsolete and incompatible with `sim11` (the current implementation). It is kept here for reference and future experiments.
