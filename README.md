# Sim1
Sim1 is an AI experiment, intended to provide a basic environment for agents modeled to represent simple organisms.

The goal is to create a simulator that mimics natural selection to:
1. Nurture genetically diverse agents, capable of surviving in their environment
2. Implement and test different AI/ML algorithms that observe and influence the agent's actions
3. Select for algorithms that provide general problem-solving capabilities resulting in optimum decision-making

It is an effort to make way for Synthetic Intelligence to be born within a simple environment.
